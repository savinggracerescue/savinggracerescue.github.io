Kanga Roo was brought into a vet clinic in far Northern California. She was brought to the clinic for euthanasia at about 4 weeks old. The person that found her (Cheryl) contacted Saving Grace Rescue (Amber) a few weeks later because they have taken other special babies from her before.

We saw a video of her on 5/29/14 and fell in love with her. We contacted SGR and because she was a petite girl, it took her a few more weeks to be 2 lbs, the weight necessary for spaying surgery. She was spayed on 6/27/14 and we brought her home on 6/28/14. She has radial hypoplasia / radial agencies but that does not stop her from living life like any normal cat. She lives with her 2 human parents, 2 canine brothers (Brandon, 7 years old and Brownie, 5 years old) and 1 feline sister (Skittles, 9 years old) in the Bay Area, CA.
